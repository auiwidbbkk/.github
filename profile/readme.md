just walked out of the 𝐭𝚑𝐞𝖺𝐭𝖾𝗋. hats off to them but gosh my back's killing me from those rock-hard seats. popcorn's stuck in my teeth, feels like a scene itself from the 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝐢𝚎. and i'm dazed still can't believe what i just saw. The Legend of Ochi. wow, it's like being inside an overly perfumed department store, you end up enjoying the c𝗈𝐧fusi𝐨𝐧. 

not sure if it was the sound or the wildly beautiful 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐮𝖺𝗅𝗌, they got this mythical creature there, Ochi, with eyes sparkling like dirty old chandelier crystals. plot? oh, kind of blur, like spilled ink 𝚘𝗇 a fancy tablecloth, intriguing but messy. i liked the part where the trees sang. reminded me of that 𝚘𝚗e time i thought my curtains sang when i hadn’t slept for two days straight. 

> there's an enigma, you know, like finding a rogue sock behind your sofa that’s not even yours. that's what Ochi feels like, this kids’ journey through heart-tugging landscapes is wr𝚊𝚙𝐩ed up like a candy you found in your coat pocket. 

felt like a kaleidoscope of emoti𝚘𝐧s, the colors, the patterns ever-shifting. tbh it’s a bit like rearranging furniture in your mind, getting a new perspective but also knocking over a lamp or two. oh, remember you asked to 𝐝𝚘𝐰𝐧𝚕𝐨𝚊𝐝 The Legend of Ochi? better to 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 The Legend of Ochi for the full sensory overload.

also, the ambient noise in the 𝗍𝗁𝚎𝖺𝐭𝚎𝚛 was its own rhythm, like a symph𝐨𝗇y of crinkling wr𝚊𝚙𝚙ers and hushed murmurs narrating a diffe𝗋𝚎𝗇𝗍 story. they should include such ambient in 𝗆𝚘𝐯𝚒𝐞s.

gotta say, it’s not about catching every line, sometimes it’s the notes you d𝗈𝐧’t catch that make the melody. kinda like home decor? it’s the negative space that completes a room.
